# EdgewareExtreme

### About
Fair warning: This project is very NSFW-centred

EdgewareExtreme is software inspired by [PetitTournesol](https://github.com/PetitTournesol) 's [Edgeware](https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware).
Its purpose is to feed the user pictures and videos of porn, so the user can focus on edging.

I decided to change things up a bit, to make usage of the original software easier, and to ass some of my own ideas. 
If you have any ideas as well, or you have some feedback, please let me know by creating an issue!

I did choose Java for my version of it, since that's the language I'm most familiar with. That means it should be working on every OS!
